    "There are a large number of symbols involved in notating even an elementary sociodynamics model.  Many of these represent the specific variables and parameters of an individual model, but some are more general and are listed here.  It's a good idea to provide each individual model with its own list of symbols, as provided (for example) in Table 5.4 of Weidlich's *Sociodynamics*.\n",
